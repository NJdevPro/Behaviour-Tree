# Behaviour-Tree
A C++11 implementation of the Behaviour Tree data structure/design pattern

This is merely an exercise based on articles read online.
The behaviour tree design pattern fills the same niche as state machines,
but it has several advantages over them:
- it is easier to maintain and understand
- it can be multithreaded

The main disadvantage is generally lower real time performance than state machines.

This implementation works but is incomplete at the moment.
