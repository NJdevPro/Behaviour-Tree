# Behaviour-Tree
A C++11 implementation of the Behaviour Tree data structure/design pattern

This is merely an exercise based on articles read online.
The behaviour tree design pattern fills the same niche as state machines,
but it has several advantages over them:
- they are easier to maintain and understand
- they can be multithreaded
This is at the expense of real time performance.

This implementation works but is incomplete at the moment.
